Input File Format:

1st line is training file name
2nd line is test file name (should be same format as training file (Y isnt required). Leave blank if you dont have a test file)
3rd line is indicies of categorical features, seperated by a comma (write "None" if there are no categorical features)

nominal features: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
remove column indicies (starting at 0): 0
missing character string:
linear regression (Y/N): N
polynomial regression (Y/N): N
ANN (Y/N): Y
ElasticNet (Y/N): Y
Random Forest (Y/N): Y


Dataset Format:

- The first row must label all the columns, and Y must be one of the labels
- Test file should be same format as training file, except Y isnt needed

Examples of proper dataset format:

X0,X1,X2,Y
1,"a",4,0
7,"q",8,3
...

Volume,Y,Temperature

How to run:

python3 ML_library.py

Input File Format:

1st line is training file name
2nd line is test file name (should be same format as training file)
3rd line is indicies of categorical features, seperated by a comma (write "None" if there are no categorical features)
4th line is a indicies of columns you want removed (write "None" if you don't want any removed)

lines 6 and after are for algorithm selection

Example input file:

dataset filename (must be .csv): output.csv
nominal features: X0,X1,X2,X3,X4,X5,X6,X7
remove column indicies (starting at 0): 0,4
missing character string: ?
linear regression (Y/N): N
polynomial regression (Y/N): N
ANN (Y/N): Y
ElasticNet (Y/N): Y
Random Forest (Y/N): Y


Dataset Format:

-The first row must label all the columns, and Y must be one of the labels

Examples of proper dataset format:

X0,X1,X2,Y
1,"a",4,0
7,"q",8,3
...

Volume,Y,Temperature
12,143,1
3,133,5

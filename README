How to run:

python3 ML_library.py

Input File Format:

1st line is training file name
2nd line is test file name (should be same format as training file (Y isnt required). Leave blank if you dont have a test file)
3rd line asks whether you want to output the predictions of each algorithm
4th line is indicies of categorical features, seperated by a comma (leave blank if there are no categorical features)
5th line is a list of indicies of columns you want removed (leave blank if you don't want any removed)
6th line is a character or String that is in place of missing values (this will be replaced by the columns median.
    Leave blank if all values are filled, "" if the values are blank)
7th line asks whether you want to drop features that have high covariate drift
lines 8 and after are for algorithm selection

Example input file:

Training filename: train.csv
Test filename: test.csv
Output predictions (Y/N): Y
nominal features: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
remove column indicies (starting at 0): 0
missing character string:
drop columns with high covariate shift (Y/N): N
linear regression (Y/N): N
polynomial regression (Y/N): N
ANN (Y/N): Y
ElasticNet (Y/N): Y
Random Forest (Y/N): Y


Dataset Format:

- The first row must label all the columns, and Y must be one of the labels
- Test file should be same format as training file, except Y isnt needed

Examples of proper dataset format:

X0,X1,X2,Y
1,"a",4,0
7,"q",8,3
...

Volume,Y,Temperature
12,143,1
3,133,5
...
